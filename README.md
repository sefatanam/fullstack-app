1. In Development
    - For running backend - `npm run backend-dev`

    - For running both - `npm run dev`

2. In Production
    - Use docker  ( note: current docker file setup for production use)

### How to update db schema
I used prisma, so checkout [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) for more info. For basic usage you can update schema and update database by doing this command, `npx prisma migrate dev --name "YOUR_MIGRATE_MESSAGE_WILL_BE_HERE"`
And for generata `type` from schema run,
`npx prisma generate`
